Re-render a movie with subtitles from file with auto-correcting delay

Small script I made for myself. I needed a way to get subtitles in movies through the built-in Windows cast function. 
My solution has been to re-render the video file with Moviepy and running some tests to determine the delay in the starting of the subtitles. 
As the .srt files are often wrong. 
It is far from finished but it works for my intentions so I don't think I will develop it further.
